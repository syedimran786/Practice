var colors=["Red","Green","Blue","Yellow"];

console.log(colors);


// for(let i=0;i<colors.length;i++)
// {
//     console.log(colors[i]);
// }

for(let col of colors)
{
    console.log(col);
}

// Whenever we use fin loop for arrays, temp variable will store index values of array Elements

for(let col in colors)
{
    console.log(col);

1.What is an Object?
    An entity which is having existance in the real world

2.What is Javascript Object?
    Javascript object is collection of related variable and functions which are represented as key and value pairs


3.What are rules for for Javascript

    1.Javascipt object is enclosed in between curly Brackets
    2.Data will be stored in the form of key and value pairs
    3.key and value will be seperated with the help of Colon(:)
    4.Key:value pair will be seperated with the help of Comma(,) 
    5.If we want acces object values we use ObjectName.keyName or ObjectName["keyName"]
    

        var student={sname:"Sheela",age:34,dept:"CSE"};
        console.log(student);
        //CRUD Operations
        // Create
        student.marks=567;
        student["grade"]="A";
        console.log(student);
        //Read
        console.log(student.sname);
        console.log(student["marks"]);
        // Update
        student.dept="ISE";
        student["sname"]="Leela";
        console.log(student);
        // Delete
        delete student.age;
        delete student["grade"];
        console.log(student);


            var student={sname:"Sheela",age:34,dept:"CSE"};

                for(let stud in student)
                {
                    console.log(stud+" : "+student[stud]);
                }

            ii.onblur
            iii.onselect
            iv.onsubmit***---->We have to use inside form tag and when we assign a function to onsubmit event we have to return the function

    Note:All the events are going to accept function as value

8.Regular Expression.
    Regular Expression is an built in object in Javascript.
    It is used to match the patterns.

        Syntax:
            var variable_name=/pattern/Modifiers
        Ex:
            var reg=/[A-Z]/g

        Modifiers
            1.g--->Global case sensitive match
            2.i-->Case in-sensitive match

        patterns

            1.[A-Z]
            2.[a-z]
            3.[0-9]
            4.[A-Za-z]
            5.[A-Z0-9]
            6.[a-z0-9]
            7.[A-Za-z0-9]


    Symbols

        1.*------>zero or more occurance
        2.+------>one or more occurance
        3.$------>Ends With
        4.^----->Starts With/Negation

            1.^[A-Z]+$
            2.[a-z]$
            3.[^0-9]
            4.^[A-Za-z]*$
            5.[^A-Z0-9]
            6.[a-z0-9]
            7.[^A-Za-z0-9]
